A [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) plugin that lets you translate any text on your Steam Deck screen.

It captures your screen, recognizes text using OCR, translates it and then shows the result with screen overlay.

Might be helpful for learning a new language by playing games or some other purposes (you tell me!).

### Text Recognition (OCR)

| Provider                                                   | Description                                                                                       | Requirements        |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| [**RapidOCR**](https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidOCR)        | On-device OCR. Screenshots never leave your device                                                | -                   |
| [**OCR.space**](https://ocr.space/)                        | Free EU-based Cloud OCR API with some usage limitations. Good choice if you dont need to translate very often | Internet            |
| [**Google Cloud Vision**](https://cloud.google.com/vision) | Best accuracy and speed. Great for complex/stylized text. Has a great free tier, but requires some setup | Internet + API key  |

### Translation

| Provider                                                           | Description                    | Requirements       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| [**Google Translate**](https://translate.google.com/)              | It's Google. And it translates | Internet           |
| [**Google Cloud Translation**](https://cloud.google.com/translate) | High quality translations      | Internet + API key |


**Note:** Google Cloud services require an API key but offer a generous free tier for personal use.

<summary><h2>Hey, I want better results. How do I get this Google Cloud API Key?</h2></summary>


### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" at the top, then "New Project"
3. Give your project a name (any name would work) and click "Create"

### Step 2: Enable Required APIs
1. Go to [APIs & Services > Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)
2. Search for and enable:
   - **Cloud Vision API**
   - **Cloud Translation API**

### Step 3: Create an API Key
1. Go to [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "API Key"
   - *Authenticate API calls through a service account*: keep unchecked
   - Application Restrictions: None
3. Copy your new API key
4. If you need to find this API key later - press "Show key" button

![API-Key-page](assets/google-cloud-key-1.jpg)
![API-Key-modal](assets/google-cloud-key-2.jpg)


### Step 4: (Optional) Restrict Your API Key
For security, you can restrict the API key to only the Vision and Translation APIs:
1. Click on your API key in the Credentials page
2. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
3. Select "Cloud Vision API" and "Cloud Translation API"
4. Click "Save"

![API-Key-Restriction](assets/google-cloud-key-4.jpg)

### Step 5: Add API Key to Plugin
1. Open the Decky Translator plugin on your Steam Deck
2. Go to the Translation tab
3. Select Google Cloud Vision and/or Google Cloud Translation as your providers
4. Click "Set Key"
5. Enter your Google Cloud API key
6. Click "Save"

### API Key usually looks like this (but you should have your own):
![API-Key-SteamOS](assets/google-cloud-key-3.jpg)

### IMPORTANT: NEVER SHARE THIS API KEY WITH ANYONE!

### Pricing Note
Google Cloud offers a free tier that should be sufficient for personal use:
- **Vision API**: First 1,000 units/month free
- **Translation API**: First 500,000 characters/month free

**From my own experience**, even everyday usage of Decky Translator with Google Cloud for both recognition and translation rarely goes beyond their free tier.
Only once I had to pay around 1€/month - and that was during VERY active development and testing phase.

**But if you want to stay on the safe side anyway** - you could set up a budget limit and notification in [Billing > Budgets & Alerts](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/budgets)

## Troubleshooting

### Black screen on capture
- Try triggering translation again
- If persistent, reboot your Steam Deck

### Translated text is too small
- Try increasing the "Font Scaling" option in plugin settings

### Plugin says I'm using a wrong API key
- Double-check that you entered it correctly. If the issue persists, please raise an issue - let's investigate it together

### I see nothing / Recognition is bad
- Try other text recognition methods - RapidOCR may not work well with stylized or pixelated text. I also plan to continuously improve recognition quality, so you can expect improvements over time

## To-Do
### Functional
- [x] Add offline OCR functionality
- [x] Fix interface scaling issues on non-default SteamOS values (experimental)
- [x] Rework temporary files solution
- [x] Gamepad support
- [x] Overlay font scaling for large monitors
- [ ] Fully offline Translation functionality
- [ ] Disable in-game buttons while overlay is active
- [ ] Desktop mode support
- [ ] Nicer look for translation overlay
- [ ] TTS for translated text (press the translated label to listen)

### Languages
- [ ] Arabic support for RapidOCR
- [ ] Hindi support for RapidOCR
- [x] Add Finnish language
- [x] Add Romanian language
- [x] Add Bulgarian language
- [x] Add Vietnamese language
